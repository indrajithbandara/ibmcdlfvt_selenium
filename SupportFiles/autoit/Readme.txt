Tool used to test non-browser applications i.e windows explorer, feedreader, DI, MS Office, etc.  This is not required for QPG UAT as the tools are self contained excutables. It is necessary for automtion development though. Install on automation machine with RFT if you are writing tests for QPG.

Updated 1/4/08.  You need version 3.2.4.9 if you are working with the new DI tools.  You need to install the autoit3lib tools.
